# [EggShell](http://lucasjackson.me/eggshell)

EggShell (formerly known as NeonEggShell) is an iOS and OS X surveillance tool written in python.  This tool creates an command line session with extra functionality like downloading files, taking pictures, location tracking, and gathering data on a target.  Communication between server and target is encrypted with a random 128 bit AES key. EggShell also has the functionality to switch between and handle multiple targets. This is a proof of concept project, intended for use on machines you own.
