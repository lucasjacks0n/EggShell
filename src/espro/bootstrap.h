/*
 *	Interface:	Bootstrap server
 *
 *  The bootstrap server is the first user-mode task initiated by the Mach
 *  kernel at system boot time.  The bootstrap server provides two services,
 *  it initiates other system tasks, and manages a table of name-port bindings
 *  for fundamental system services  (e.g. lookupd, Window Manager, etc...).
 *
 *  Name-port bindings can be established with the bootstrap server by either
 *  of two mechanisms:
 *
 *  1.  The binding can be indicated, in advance of the service that backs it
 *  being available, via a "service create" request.  In this case, bootstrap
 *  will immediately create a port and bind the indicated name with that port.
 *  At a later time, a service may "checkin" for the name-port
 *  binding and will be returned receive rights for the bound port.  Lookup's
 *  on bindings created by this mechanism will return send rights to the port,
 *  even if no service has "checked-in".  In this case, requests sent to the
 *  bound port will be queued until a server has checked-in and can satisfy the
 *  request.
 *
 *  2.  Bindings can be established dynamically via a "register" request.  In
 *  this case, the register request provides bootstrap with a name and send
 *  rights for a port.  Bootstrap will provide send rights for the bound port
 *  to any requestor via the lookup request.
 *
 *  Bootstrap provides its service port to descendant tasks via the Mach
 *  "bootstrap" special task port.  All direct descendants of bootstrap receive
 *  a "privileged" bootstrap service port.  System services that initiate
 *  untrusted tasks should replace the Mach bootstrap task special port with
 *  a subset bootstrap port to prevent them from infecting the namespace.
 *
 *  The bootstrap server creates a "backup" port for each service that it
 *  creates.  This is used to detect when a checked out service is no longer
 *  being served.  The bootstrap server regains all rights to the port and
 *  it is marked available for check-out again.  This allows crashed servers to
 *  resume service to previous clients.  Lookup's on this named port will
 *  continue to be serviced by bootstrap while holding receive rights for the
 *  bound port.  A client may detect that the service is inactive via the
 *  bootstrap status request.  If an inactive service re-registers rather
 *  than "checking-in" the original bound port is destroyed.
 *
 *  The status of a named service may be obtained via the "status" request.
 *  A service is "active" if a name-port binding exists and receive rights
 *  to the bound port are held by a task other than bootstrap.
 *
 *  The bootstrap server may also (re)start server processes associated with
 *  with a set of services. The definition of the server process is done
 *  through the "create server" request.  The server will be launched in the
 *  same bootstrap context in which it was registered.
